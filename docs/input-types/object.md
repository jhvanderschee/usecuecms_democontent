If you have lots of frontmatter fields you can group them with an object. Objects look like this:

    properties:
      date: 2021-10-17
      category: news

This object will be represented in the CMS as:

    properties (2 key/value pairs)

When you click this object it will show a new page with date and category input. When you click "save" the changes will be saved (but not yet comitted or published).
