To start you can [sign up](/sign-up) for an account. We will check your Hugo website for compatibility with Usecue CMS. If it is not compatible, we will send you instructions on how to make your website compatible. Things that are NOT supported are:

- sub-sections
- content in page bundles other than in index.md
- media files outside the static/uploads directory

Along with the instructions on how to make your website compatible, we will send you a quote for using Usecue CMS. Note that we have very competitive pricing.
