Welcome to the documentation site of [cms.usecue.com](https://cms.usecue.com). This documentation is written for developers creating websites, not for users maintaining content on websites. If you want to know how to use the CMS, please refer to the [end user manual](/docs/user-manual).

{{< windows >}}

Usecue CMS is a Hugo specific, zero config, multi user, mobile friendly, Git based CMS. It is geeky and thatâ€™s exactly how we like it. Want to get started? [Read this first](/docs/getting-started)!

## Prior knowledge

Developers who read this documentation are expected to be experienced in building Hugo sites. This website explains all the specific [features](/docs/features) of this CMS, but it does not explain how Hugo works. For more information on Hugo visit it's [official documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/).
