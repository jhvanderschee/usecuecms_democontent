title: Git based
---

This CMS doen not only use Git, it is truly ‘Git based’ and supports not only Git commits, but also Git commit messages with their proper authors. This last thing means that not just Git users, but also CMS users will be visible in your Git history. This allows you to easily find not only WHEN, but also WHO changed certain content on your website.

A typical commit, where John Doe is the CMS user, would look like this:

```
Homepage updated (commit a40ba19)
John Doe authored and usecue-cms committed one hour ago
```
