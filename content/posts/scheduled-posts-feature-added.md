One of our clients posts a LOT of news articles and was requesting a scheduled posts feature. She wanted to create posts that went live automatically on a set date. To do this, we created the option to rebuild the website daily. This is also a great feature when you want to automatically remove past events from your website. 

We are happy to be able to support these both use cases. This makes Usecue CMS another step closer to perfection! Happy content editing!
