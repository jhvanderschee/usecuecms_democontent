Some people want to preview their changes before they go live (for approval or other reasons). To accommodate this we have added a preview functionality. This is an alternative git push target (remote) that can be pushed to from the dashboard. If a preview environment is set, a 'push to preview' button will appear on the dashboard, once you committed your changes.
