If you have javascript enabled, we will automagically hide everything but the first 25 items in a folder that is ordered by date. This makes it easier to reach the 'add item' button (in the footer). We hide these older items by default because older posts are rarely edited/accessed. A single click on 'show older items' displays the whole list. We believe this change improves the usability.

Happy editing!!!
