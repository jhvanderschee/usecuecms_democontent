Here is our view on a reasonable fee for a small to medium sized business website:

Hosting&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 euro  
Bandwidth&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 euro  
Traffic&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 euro  
CMS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 euro  
Form&nbsp;handling&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 euro  
Spam&nbsp;filter&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 euro  
Statistics&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 euro

Total&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30 euro/month

Bandwidth should be unthrottled and traffic unlimited (within reason). A fee of 30 euro is on par with other managed hosting solutions, like WordPress.com (25-45), Wix (29), Squarespace (23-49), etc. Ofcourse you should expect to pay a premium for additional services like extended support, training, a technical account manager, etc.

Note that you can probably get a better deal when you outsource the hosting to a free hosting platform, like Cloudflare or Vercel, where traffic is limited and CPU and bandwidth are throttled. However, this also means that your deploy times will be minutes instead of seconds and you might have to pay for overages.
