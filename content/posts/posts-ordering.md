Pages are typically ordered alphabetically in the CMS, with a natural case insensitive ordering. There are also pages in the CMS that contain a date. These pages (often blog posts) should be ordered by date in descending order. The CMS now detects the existence of dates and automatically orders pages appropriately. Hope you like it!
