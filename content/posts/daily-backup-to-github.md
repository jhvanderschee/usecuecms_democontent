Usecue CMS uses Git internally. However people would love to see their changes reflected in their Github account. That's why we added a daily Github sync feature. Now you can use Github to browse your website's change history. With [this feature](/uploads/daily-backup.png) Github becomes a backup for your Usecue CMS changes.
