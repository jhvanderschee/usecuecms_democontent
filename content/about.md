Usecue CMS is a product that has been developed for the customers of [Usecue BV](https://www.usecue.com/). Usecue hosts over 80 websites that use this CMS and we are slowly opening up to other companies. 

We wanted a better CMS and better hosting integration. It started with [instant deploys](/docs/features/instant-deployments) and [full mobile support](/docs/features/mobile-friendly), but soon involved things like commit messages, shortcode support, form/spam handling, faster pageloads and much more.

We have been using competitive products before developing this CMS. Therefore we know exactly what we and our customers value in a CMS and an integrated hosting solution. Additionally, we have a very clear picture of the prices and costs of those products. Therefore, we feel confident to say that we can deliver MUCH more quality for a similar price, now and in the future.

Are you interested in the advantage our CMS could give you and your company? [Jump on board](/sign-up)!
