title: List of objects
---
You can mix objects and lists, for instance to create a list of objects:

    items:
      - title: Docs
        url: /docs/
      - title: Blog
        url: /blog/
      - title: Sign up
        url: /sign-up/

This will be represented in the CMS as a [clickable link](/uploads/screenshots/data-menu.png). When you click this link it brings you to the [list editor](/uploads/screenshots/data-menu2.png) where the representation of each list item is the first text field in the item (in this case "title").
