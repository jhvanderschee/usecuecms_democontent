title: Zero config
---

Unlike many other CMS systems you do not need to configure this CMS. Just connect it to your Hugo website and you should be ready to go! We automatically transform [your data](/uploads/screenshots/usecuecms1.png) into [an online CMS](/uploads/screenshots/usecuecms2.png). 

This means that we guess which input type is most suitable for the fields of your page. For example, when you use a field that ends in '_date' or is called 'date', we automatically give you a date picker. Another example is that fields with section names will automatically be converted in a select field, allowing you to choose one or more items of that specific section. For more information on this, see the [input types](/docs/input-types/). 

Additionally, we also have custom [shortcode support](/docs/features/shortcode-support).
