This 'getting started guide' is written for developers creating websites, not for (end) users managing content. If you want to know how to use the CMS, please view our [end user manual](/docs/user-manual).

## Config file setup

For a smooth start with Usecue CMS it is relevant to setup your [config file](/docs/getting-started/config-file) correctly.

## One upload directory

Please take into account that we put all 'user files' (files that are added by the CMS users) in one [upload directory](/docs/getting-started/upload-dir).

## The sign up process

When you sign up for an account we will check your Hugo website for compatibility with Usecue CMS. [Read more](/docs/getting-started/sign-up-process)
