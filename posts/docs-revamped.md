title: Docs revamped
date: 2023-02-06

We have improved the documentation section of this website. Everything is now focussed on developers, except for the [end user manual](/docs/user-manual/). The design we used is inspired by the documentation websites of Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages and the likes. A search functionality will follow. We are currently working on updating all screenshots in the documentation, as they are outdated. We will keep you posted.

Our documentation website is a Hugo website, that can be managed by Usecue CMS. We have used the auto-collapsing menu solution from [Hugo Codex](https://hugocodex.org/add-ons/nested-menu/) to make it ultra flexible.
