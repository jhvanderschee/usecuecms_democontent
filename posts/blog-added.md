We like to keep you posted on everything that is going on. That is why we added this blog. All feature releases will be posted here, as well as interesting articles about Usecue CMS. 

One day we might post here that we have been acquired by a big hosting platform in the Jamstack scene, but that is still a long way to go (if it will ever happen). Until then we are the underdog, which gives you a massive amount of value for money. Even better: because we already have a solid user base (thus make a profit) and because Usecue CMS is part of a privately owned (family) business, continuity is guaranteed. This does not only mean we will still exist ten years from now, but also that we cannot be forced to change our strategy by our shareholders.
