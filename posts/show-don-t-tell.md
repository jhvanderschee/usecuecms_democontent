We have added an image to the homepage of this website. It is a picture of a simplified code editor along with a simplified CMS view. It shows you what Usecue CMS does: transform your code into a CMS.

The best thing about Usecue CMS is that it does so with 'zero configuration'. Every Hugo website should work out of the box. However, we will help you set up your Hugo project in the most optimal way in our [getting started guide](/docs/getting-started/config-file/).
