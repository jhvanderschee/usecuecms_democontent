Scalable Vector Graphics, or SVG, are a vector-based image format developed for the web. Because SVG is a vector format, image render in the same manner – and in perfect detail – regardless of size. All major web browsers support this format. Did you know that you can use SVG's also as image maps? It supports bitmap content (embedded) and hyperlinks.

Usecue CMS now shows JPEG thumbnails of SVG images and low resolution PNG previews. This makes sure the CMS stays ultra-fast, while we support individual SVG files that are several megabytes large.
